<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Every person is unique in his way,” said the famous poet Milton. God sends everyone in this world with some potential and some noble purpose to serve. Now, the question is whether or not we are aware of this special potential we possess.</p>

<p>In this respect, I am quite conscious of my potential. But initially, I did not know that my IQ in science was a little perfect. I came to know that once I was awarded the 1st position in the science quiz. It helped me to identify my area of interest. Today, I participate in various quizzes and competitions and receive many awards and laurels.</p>

<p>I am Prathyusha, hailing from the state of Karnataka. I am presently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics engineering from VTU. Moreover, I am proficient as well as a capable and confident person. I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my career from the very core. Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion.</p>

<p>I never pursued bookish knowledge and it is certainly true that only a book doesn’t let you have sufficient experience and knowledge about the practical world. Training myself as a singer and always keeping myself balanced with my career had finally made me reach, where I am today. Recently I have also taken a new course on yoga, and I keep trying to win it too.</p>

<p>My father taught me to be courageous in difficult times and keep myself motivated. My father is a teacher, and My mother is a housewife. It is truly said that ambience judges your capability. Seeing my father being very punctual and dedicated to his profession and my mother being always caring to the people I have always tried to keep myself a very helpful and humble person.</p>

<p>Also, as we talk about family, our friends are the next people we think about in our lives. The contribution of friends should never be ignored. I always have the back of my few friends who are with me, through the thick and thin. Even in my school days, my friends always motivated me to discover myself. So, I can say that I am pretty satisfied with my surroundings and I’m really grateful to God for giving me a supportive ambience altogether in my life.</p>

<p> It’s not necessary to only complain about what life has not given you, rather it is to find out what life has actually in store for you. God has given everyone the potential, and how we use it is in our hands. We weave our present to see a beautiful design in the future.</p>

<p>As a role model, I always look upon the freedom fighters as my inspiration, and I always dream of being like them. I am driven by their enthusiasm, energy, and vitality, with which they won various battles of their life and made the world a better place, as it is today. Therefore, it is in our hands how we master ourselves to look into a beautiful future, and I truly believe in this. Best of luck to all of my friends”.</p>
