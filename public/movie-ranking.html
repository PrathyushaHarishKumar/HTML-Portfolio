<h2>My Top 2 Recommendations</h2>

<h3>Pride and Prejuidice</h3>
<p>"Pride and Prejudice" is a timeless classic that has captivated readers for generations.
    <br />
    Written by Jane Austen, the novel tells the story of Elizabeth Bennet, a witty and headstrong young woman who finds herself falling in love with the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. One of the things that sets it apart from other novels of its time is its sharp wit and incisive social commentary. 
    <br />
    Austen's writing is both clever and insightful, and she uses the story of Elizabeth and Darcy's romance to explore themes of class, gender, and social norms in Regency-era England.
    But what really makes this novel such a beloved classic is its unforgettable characters. From the charming and impulsive Elizabeth to the brooding and enigmatic Darcy, the novel is full of richly drawn and complex figures who are both relatable and fascinating. 
    <br />
    And with a plot that is full of twists and turns, the book is a page-turner from start to finish. Overall, I would highly recommend "Pride and Prejudice" to anyone who loves a good romance or a well-crafted work of literature. The book is a true masterpiece, and its insights into human nature and the complexities of love and relationships are just as relevant today as they were when Austen first wrote them.</p>
<h3>Little Women</h3>    
<p>An absolutely delightful watch! I definitely recommend you to watch this movie, with your family especially, as it beautifully portrays the familial bonds these four sisters share. How they accompany and support each other when their father is out for war, and manage to stay happy with the little they have. Joe, being the tomboy has a fair share banters with Amy, who despises her 'unladylike' mannerisms. Then we have Meg, the eldest who's a great companion to all and little Beth, who is way mature for her years. Having such wonderful daughters, Marmee, who is played excellently by Laura Dern, believes that they'll always look out for each other. Next, we have the boy next door, Laurie, played by the charming Timothee Chalamet, who is one friend all the girls have in common, besides themselves. Here's how their perfect compatibility is shown, the March sisters, though not the most financially strong, have rich familial bonds, the Lawrence household has a richness unparallel, yet they yearn for human connection and support. 
<br />
Other than the perfect casting, Greta Gerwig has displayed two timelines pretty seamlessly, when all four of them were together, there's a golden tinge of youth and happiness while when they get separated, due to Meg's marriage, Joe's desire for being an author, Amy's desire of painting and Beth being inflicted with scarlett fever, there's a coldness so distinguishable, that one can almost feel it while watching the movie.
<br /> 
A simple story, following the lives of four simple girls, is really a reminder of the importance of happiness in our lives and the kinds of people we surround ourselves with. How, with different circumstances and emotions, can we maintain the same kind of relationship we have with them. Trust me, you'll feel so good after watching this film, you'll never ever fail to forget it.</p>
